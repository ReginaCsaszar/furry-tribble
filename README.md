(Tribbles are a fictional alien species in the Star Trek universe. They are small, furry, soft, slow-moving, and they usually produce a soothing purring or cooing sound when stroked. However, because tribbles reproduce incredibly fast, and consume exponentially large amounts of food as they multiply and crawl stealthily from one place to another, Starfleet considers them dangerous organisms and forbids their transportation. The Klingons consider them mortal enemies.)
